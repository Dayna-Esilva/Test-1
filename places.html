         <h1>These few places sometimes mean the world to me</h1>
         <h2>Shops</h2>
         <p>Bliss monger - magic , calming space - from clothing to jewelry to stones the bliss monger is a fav to go to.  They have so many patterned clothing that flows in the wind so effortlessly.  The music within the shop are chilled vibes tunes with a scent of sage. </p>

         <h2>Plant Places and peaceful Walks</h2>
         <p>My fav place to go for walks and look around is the Lifestyle Home  Garden in Randburg - the staff are super nice and welcoming, the variety of succulents , roses with amazing scents and many others. There is a beautiful cafe that is surrounded by the plants. The rows of collies allow one to just breathe and soak it all in like a plant. 
            The Bryanston Pet shop not only has fish and snakes but outside the shop is a beautiful nursery that I would say actually is my true favorite just because of location - much closer , easy to get to and is always a good time. I always seem to walk out with either a small plant or seedlings just for fun like sunflowers.</p>
