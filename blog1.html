        <h1>The Library of Babel</h1>
        <p>
            The library contains everything and is often described as infinite. The hexagonal shapes allows for the library to store as much information as possible and create a “necessary shape of absolute space”, (Borges, 1998) or at least the illusion of it. However if the exact number of books and words in each book is given is the number really an infinite one? Some idealists argue that “a triangular or pentagonal chamber is inconceivable” (Borges, 1998) which also questions whether the library is actually infinite or not. Men have also argued that that due to there being a mirror in the library, it can not be infinite as if it was “what need would there be for that illusory replication?”. (Borges, 1998) The librarian however is in belief of the library being infinite as he states that when he dies he will fall for ages and “my body will sink for ages”. (Borges, 1998) This creates an interesting argument and I think it is worth focusing on as the word infinite is often thrown around so carelessly. As humans do we have an access to an infinite amount of knowledge, and if not how do we know this? And if everything has already been written in these books then how can the amount of knowledge be infinite? These questions are vital as they show the importance of the library. Infinite or not, we know that the library "contains everything which can be expressed in all languages”, (Borges, 1998) meaning for every question or problem there is an answer or solution in some book, we must just know where to look. The library does however provide comfort in the fact that even if the human race becomes extinct, our knowledge or everything we could have learned will continue through these books from this library. The creation of this library was not only to create knowledge, but also to install hope, “The books reception creates order from disorder”. (Borges, 1998) This may seem unrealistic, like a joke or a hoax but surely enough as Basile insists: ‘Every possible permutation of letters is accessible at this very moment in one of the library’s books, only waiting its discovery’. But it is also a valid point to not get lost in the endless combinations in the books within the library. The people in Borge’s story who wander the library for years show a similar reflection in todays society and use of social media. It is easy to get lost on twitter or facebook or instagram trying to find some specific information however at the end of the day you are just wasting your time trying to find a combination of words that may never appear.
