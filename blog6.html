         <h1>What is/are the digital divide/s and how do they affect us/you?</h1>
         <p>The Digital Divide focuses on those members of society who don’t have access to computers or the internet. This refers to underprivileged members of society such as the poor, handicapped, rural and elderly portion. The focus is on the gap between these members and the wealthy middle class urban members of society. Race, class and gender all come into play when discussing the digital divide, especially the intersectionality of all these groups. When accessing what creates the gap between these members of society, three levels come into play; access, how the internet is used/the inequalities that exist, and the social/cultural benefits. The digital divide also includes the social capital, which refers to the different relationships between individuals, otherwise known as human interrelationship. It is vital to focus on the digital divide as it is only birthing the divisions in society, such as the distribution of wealth. Those who have access to computers and the internet have access to expanding knowledge and communication platforms, while those who do not can not become richer through the power of information. The aim is to close the digital divide, as we live in a society that is so linked to technology, and if you do not have access to it, you will be left in the dark ages and the divide will continue to widen. The digital divide can already be seen in society today, and it has many compounding effects. When analysing the digital divide, wealth and access to computers are not the only things that should be considered, as illiteracy plays a huge role as well. The digital divide can not be closed if literacy is not promoted all over the world in the first place. In South Africa members of society who are excluded from technology are severely affected and this creates a huge inequality, including career and education opportunities. However in South Africa the issue is not only access, but also empowering people to become confident enough to use computers and understand technology. Again this references the literacy and educational standards within the South African population. When trying to find a long term solution to solving the digital divide within South Africa the focus should be on trying to uplift the socio-economic standard of the community. South Africa also faces a huge struggle in bridging this gap as we are such an inequitable society with a huge difference between the wealthy and poor people. “The 2001 Jensen research found that Internet access in South Africa was largely confined to urban areas, and that Internet users were predominantly white, city-dwellers, relatively affluent and well educated.”, this further shows how big the divide within our society is. The main focus stands with education, as previously disadvantaged communities have not been exposed to technology and computer literacy. “Through appropriate technologies, it is hoped that South Africa will leapfrog into the new century, bypassing the unnecessary adoption cycle, and implement a solution that works now, and has the capacity to handle future developments” (Department of Education 2003:10).” Article title Levels of Digital Divide in South Africa URL http://www.ngopulse.org/article/2020/08/28/levels-digital-divide-south-africa Website title NGO Pulse Date accessed June 03, 2021 Date published August 28, 2020 URL https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/digital-divide/start.html Website title The Digital Divide Date accessed June 03, 2021</p>
