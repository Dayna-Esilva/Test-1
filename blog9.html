         <h1>What is information geography and why does it matter?</h1>
         <p>GIS otherwise known as geography information system is a business information management system that allows data to be captured and then analysed on a spatial information map. Through the use of this geography better decisions can be made. GIS can find patterns in activities which allows for more trends and patterns to be displayed on digital map. The map being digital makes the data more easily visible and understandable in comparison to displaying it on a spreadsheet. GIS software can be found running on computers which may have very powerful servers or it can even be found on your phone. A GIS stores information about the real world and this stored through a group of thematic layers which are linked by geography. The internet is clarified by distinct geographies. All the information on the technology has to exist somewhere. There are two important points to recognise when talking about internet geographies; data shadows which are “the layers of digital information about places (Graham 2010)” and the digital divisions of labor which is the “distinct and uneven geographies of the production of digital information (Graham 2014). The geographies of information contribute to how we produce, enact, and reproduce political processes and practices as well as social and economic practices. Maps help to make sense of things and using maps geographic information can be better understood and this can contribute to a better understanding of how the connectivity of the web is around the world. The reason why GIS is so important is because it has so many different applications. This technology can be applied in many different ways, for example to aid and develop humanitarian aids and planning businesses and market research and itnellegiance and so on. Another very relevant examples is apps such as uber eats and google maps and the geographical amps allow for ones device to be tracked and the location to be determined. GIS is important as show in the above example it helps individuals and organisations become more aware and unstained spatial patterns and relationships. With GIS being able to access any information which includes location, a lot of advancements can be made. With this system the location can be displayed in different formats, such as address, latitude and longitude or ZIP code. GIS allows for the comparison of different things and it also compares hw they relate to one another. For example if a factory were to be built it was need to reference a geographical map to ensure it does not pollute any near by water sources. This is what makes GIS so important and why we will continue to use it amongst many technological platforms.
