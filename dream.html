             <h1>WHY DO WE DREAM?</h1>
            <img src="./img/artdream.jpg" alt="dreams explained" title="bonus blog" width="600" height="500">
            <p>
                Dreams are strange things-emotionally charged,
                intensely vivid parts of our nighttime lives in which
                the rules of the waking world seem not to apply.
                Most dreams occur during a critical stage of sleep
                called REM (rapid eye movement). During REM, the
                brain's activity is very similar to the waking state. But
                even as neurons fire away, signals to the spinal cord
                are suppressed, keeping the body mos paralyzed.
                Science continues to uncover what happens during REM
                sleep, but why we dream remains a mystery engaging
                scientists across disciplines. Early psychological
                theories of dreams emphasized unconscious conflict
                dreams as places to act out repressed impulses or
                forbidden desires through symbolic representations.
                Contemporary research suggests that dreams may serve
                functions important to our evolutionary success, like
                integrating the day's new memories into long-term
                storage or giving us the chance to practice responding
                Another prominent theory is that dreams emerge from the
                mind's constant need to process and interpret sensory
                information, as it does during the day. Breakthroughs in
                neuroimaging technology have revealed that whereas
                visual and motor areas are active during dreams, the
                brain's reasoning center (the prefrontal cortex) is less
                activated. As signals flash randomly throughout the visual
                to simulated threats without any actual risk to safety.
                areas, the prefrontal cortex may be struggling to impose
                order on this chaotic sensory information, perhaps
                explaining why during a dream it somehow "makes sense"
                that we are walking through a forest at one moment and
                a city the next. Our scientific understanding of dreams
                and their functions is far from complete, but it may be
                that the mind's attempt to interpret random firings within
                the brain-without the benefit of logical reasoning is what
                allows us, at night, to defy the laws of gravity and fly.
