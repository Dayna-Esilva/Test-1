            <p class="intro">Hi, I'm Claire Bell, and welcome to my world. The world of Claire and on here is where you will learn about me. I love to write blogs, obs ;) , enjoy creating abstract art that is mainly inspired by my environmental surroundings. By walking in more areas and parks I find the plants that are too good to be true. These plants not only help inspire me but they also make sure my mental health is stable. I water my plants and talk to them as if they were my very own. 

               The plants that I find not only help me but they can help you too. Like plants, we need to be taken care of and this is where my knowledge comes in to help you. To share this knowledge and appreciation I have created this very website for your disposal. 
               
               Creating this website is a good example of extending my art into the digital design field, making sure there is easy access for all. This website will not only indulge you into the plant world of mental health but also showcase new works of art. 
               
               To find out more, subscribe for new weekly blogs.</p>
