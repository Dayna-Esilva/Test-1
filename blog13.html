         <h1>Tik Tok Algorithmand its Bias</h1>
         <p>Tik Tok has become a majorly influential app over the past few years, but with its rise to popularity, its algorithms have also been put under the scope. Tik Tok aims to give you content it thinks you will like, but an accidental bias has surfaced due to this. The recommendations tend to focus of the physical appearance on people as apposed to other elements and character traits. An AI researcher at UC Berkeley, Marc Faddoul, conducted a small experiment, where he took a look at his account and found that all of his recommendations were accounts with similar profile pictures, they also matched the race, age and facial characteristics of people he had previously followed. He then created a new account and followed people at random who appeared on his For You Page. He concluded that following someone with a certain physical feature, would lead to him being recommended to follow another person with that same physical feature. The recommendations even got so into detail that men with visual disabilities would be recommended to each other as well. A spokesperson Tik Tok states that 
            "Our recommendation of accounts to follow is based on user behavior,‚Äù, however this has created un unconscious bias within the algorithm. Faddoul responds to this statement by saying even though the app is very appearance driven, this does not create a personalised experience for you, but rather traps you in a filter bubble, where you can only see the same kind of people and not become exposed to others. The app also follows recommending people of the same age, for example you you like or follow an elderly man, more elderly men will be recommended. However, when racial bias is included, the app takes it a bit far. When it comes to minorities, its going to be harder to recommend famous people who are exactly like them. This creates a smaller bubble for people were they are only exposed to a small group of people who all have the same opinions. Opinions in this this sense means how people look, seeing as Tik Tok mainly consists of videos of people. Even though Tik Tok claims that the algorithm is not purposely biased, it is still seen in the filter bubbles that appear within the app. Tik Tok focuses on maintaining peoples attention, however in doing this they create a racial segregation. Tik Tok influences millions of people daily, and this results in users getting stuck in the same cycle of content, and even when one tries to branch out to new content, the algorithm still aims to keep you in a bubble of the same content.
