         <h1>Ethical implementation of UX</h1>
         <p>Ethical implementation of the UX occurs when one crosses the line of making easy and quick decisions to better the system instead of those that better the users experience. When dealing with the user experience its must be a fully thought out process where all aspects are considered. Topics and issues that arise must also be addressed in a professional manner. UX always has a main aim of creating a website or platform that makes users feel comfortable and easy to interact with. Seeing as users of today can leave reviews or comments of a site or app online very easily, it is important to aim for positive critiques as this will lead to good PR. This is why planning is so important and why all ethical concerns must be addressed in order to avoid any public disasters. However ethics in UX is not seen as a binding rule, but rather a number of professional tips that ultimately help you improve your predicted for your targeted users. Things such as micro-actions and processes with in reference to requests for permissions, registration and monetisation are often the topics that a creator should surround with ethical questions. For each of theses questions, the best solution should always be found, and not the easiest or quickest. An example of ethical implementation can be seen in social apps such as Skype, as it offers the opportunity to be connected without being seen. This is seen in many other platforms and it focuses on the users value of privacy. Therefore the social/commercial need becomes over ridden by the customers need for privacy, and this becomes an ethical consideration that must be addressed in all social platforms. This creation of privacy and accompanying the users needs creates an environment where people become more willing to try new apps or websites. It will always be beneficial to allow for there to be flexibility towards the users needs. Allow people to share want only they want to share creates a more trusting user base and therefore ultimately allows new users to operate in an unregistered mode. Ethical considerations must also be implemented when passwords or banking details are required. It is the platforms responsibility to make the user feel that they can trust the platform with this information and in turn, the platform must have safety measures in place that create this trust.
