         <h1>The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture</h1>
         <p>
             Well before we look at the relationship that changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture have, we should make an effort to define each one on their own. Economists have defined technological change as “a shift to a new production function resulting from an increase in the efficiency of a product or process, is the main source of economic growth”. (Norcliffe 2020) This states that economists see technological change in a positive light. However this can not be the case as there is also a concern for the social implications. This is where I think, it links to the development and spread of internet culture. Internet culture is difficult to explain as the internet is so diverse that it makes it impossible to pinpoint certain things. However if you focus on technological advances and the affect that they have on social media, which does go under internet culture in my opinion, then you can begin to see the intriguing and love hate relationship that they have with one another. With the advancement of phones, computers, apps etc. many positives and negatives have arisen via social media. On the positive side it allows for more connections to be made and easier access to information. For adolescents who are finding themselves in this world it can create a sense of belonging or aid in the development of their identity, this too can contribute to ones mental health in a positive way. Platforms such as youtube create a new style of careers, where you can share your passion or any of your work with everyone online. The advancement of technology allows people from all over the world to work together and communicate from the comfort of their own homes. However, even with all the advancements and positive effects that they have had on social media, there is still a dark side. The internet creates a “paradox for social connectedness”. (A.Allen 2020) With the connectedness can also come an isolation. Due to technological advances, information is spread quickly and easily and once it is out there, there is no taking it back. On social media it creates “cancel culture” and allows hate to be spread within seconds. A simple tweet can lead to loss of your job and the end of your reputation. Cyberbullying has become a new norm for teenagers to grow up with and online predators can be found lurking everywhere. So is the link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture a good or a bad one? I think that depends on the generation you ask. Gen Z and millennials who have grown up around social media don’t know any different, and older generations don’t understand all the social media trends. I know I am speaking very broadly and assuming a lot, but maybe these are the conversations we should be having, because at the end of the day behind every phone, laptop, computer screen, is just another human being.
