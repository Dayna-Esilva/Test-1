            How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web? 
         </h1>

            The Canadian philosopher Marshal McLuhan created an interesting piece of work which included the study of media theory. Overtime it has become the most influential work that was written in the 60s and has shed immense light on how the world wide web effects humans and interactions today. The medium is the message shows how the medium becomes more valuable than the message itself as it has a direct and immediate effect on the message. Marshal McLuhan defines the medium as "any extension of ourselves.” When this is applied to humans and their understanding of the web things become interesting. Today digital media includes anything from the internet or mobile platforms as well as mass communication on these platforms. Therefore when discussing the medium of the web it will include: email, social media and websites. As of 2021 over half of the worlds population is linked to social media or uses online tools in one way or another. Communicating via social media or anything online includes characteristics that change how a message is interpreted by one another, for example because of social media and the new language it creates when communicating with each other, people now physically say LOL when talking to each other instead of actually laughing. This shows how the web has not only become an extension of ourselves but is present in our everyday interactions. The web also becomes an extension of ourselves, however this can be seen as a good or a bad thing as the extension is not always an honest one. Users get to choose how they present themselves online, and this shows how the medium affects the individual, as they way it is used determines the value of it. Generation Z further shows how the web has changed how we interact with one another and see ourselves. In the past privacy was seen as binary, however due to how the web has evolved, younger generations now see privacy as scalable. (Heick, 2017) McLuhan argued that the medium is more powerful and impactful than we understand, “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”(McLuhan, 1964) This shows how detrimental the consequences of the web can be. From cyberbullying to canceling celebrity figures the medium can be used to harm others, sometimes even unintentionally. Once something is posted or uploaded there is no taking it back, and the medium will control how humans associate and interact with the post or upload. For example a simple tweet by Justine Sacco, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!”, managed to get her fired before she even landed in South Africa. This shows how powerful the medium is and how it becomes an extension of ourselves, even when we don’t want it to be. McLuhan also brings up another interesting point that can relate to how the ever fast changing and evolving technology affects individuals as well. McLuhan noticed that humans tend to focus a lot on the obvious, and by only focusing on the obvious we miss out on subtly structural changes that may occur over a long period of time. This can be linked to how our understanding of the web has dramatically changed since it first began, however we do not notice it as much as the technological advances are subtle. For example now days being tagged on social media or sent a DM is more than just a communication, younger generations often view it as a hug, a way of saying hello or even a passive-aggressive style of bullying. (Heick, 2017) This shows how much the medium has affected how we communicate and interact with each other day to day. The medium is the message creates a much grander understanding of the web, however the web is officially a part of our day to day lives, and with that in mind the relationship that we have with it should be reconsidered and re-evaluated.
