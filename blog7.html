         <h1>Methods for analysis and critiques of UX and/or UI (based on additional research and readings)
        </h1>
        <p>User experience references and measures the interaction between a users and a user interface, for example a website or an app. Measurement tools such as heat mapping, A/B testing and marketing research are often used to analyse user experience. By using these tools certain conclusions can be made and the website or web design is then changed or adapted in order to create a more suitable user experience. This improvement of a website or web design allows for the increase if user engagement and this engagement is referred to as user interface design (UI). The overall aim is to increase the amount of time that a user spends on a page or website, which leads to online lead generation and lead conversion. Thanks to the different methods of analysis for websites, how the user interacts with a website can be measured. It is important to be able to identify the elements that make users spend longer on the page and which elements cause users to leave a page. These two things are known as “page stay” and “bouncing and exiting”. A/B testing on the other hand allows differentiations of things, such as a button colour or text, to be tested and examined in a controlled environment. Heat mapping uses the motion of the mouse to track where a users eye is on the screen, as there is a known connection between the mouse movement and eye focus. Not only are all these tools and many more very informative, but they are also highly actionable. When critiquing the UX or creating a design critique one often gives feedback, after the design has been analysed, and states whether it is meeting its objectives or not. However the design is not judged or harshly evaluated, but rather a group of people gather together to create a conversation with a main goal of aiming to improve the overall design. Often design critiques split into two different categories; design reviews and standalone critiques. Evaluations of a design are made based off a set of heuristics when looking at design reviews, and these are often done by a usability expert or in a meeting at the end of the creative process. Standalone critiques however are meeting where the purpose is only to focus and improve on one piece of particular work. A UI critique however does not solely focus on the presentation of the product in the moment, but rather on how it works over a period of time and whether it is best suiting the user’s needs. When critiquing both UX and UI, it is important to stay objective within the discussion and consider the mental modal of each individual who is interacting with the design, and this becomes a critical part in how the solution is formed.
