         <h1>Geographies of information - a critical discussion</h1>
         <p>Geographies of information are extremely important and valuable as they contribute to how we are able to understand and interpret different parts of the world. However one must not over simplify geographic augmentations, they not only represent places, they become a very part of that place, and hence the word ‘shape’ is used when referring to a geographical location. When discussing geographies you must keep three factors in mind; geographies of participation, of access and of representation. Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies” discussed a wide variety of platforms such as hosting, delivering and mediating many different types of geographic information. The main feature of the paper however focuses on how geographic information in its own way is distinguished by a host of uneven geographies. Immutable mobiles also plays a huge role in information geographies as it refers to “are those objects produced by inscription and transported back to the centre, and then combined with other such objects.” (Latour, 1986) A perfect example would be a digital map. This creation of immutable mobiles became a huge part of history and society as this meant that power and the control of information is linked. Therefore, when referencing geography of information one can conclude that the geographic spread of information is and always will be linked to control and power formation. Another point to focus on about the immutable augmentations and mobile tools is how they allow us to access certain information and how not everyone has immediate access to this information as the whole world does not have access to the internet. The digital divide shows this gap clearly. However it is not a complete set back as in comparison to pre-digital geographies of information, the opportunity to equalise the amount of people who have access to and can contribute knowledge online has improved immensely, and this improvement does not rely on their geographic placing. Geographies also rely on the understanding of geographies of participation. When discussing geographies of participation there are three variables that must be kept in mind: domain names, Github users and Wikipedia edits. These domains do not simply stand on their own, but they also stand for many global communities and go beyond the details of any singular place. By investigating the relationship between these three domains, patterns in participation can be observed as well as understand how differently each user interacts with each platform. However when examining how these domains are used globally, a bipartite relationship reveals itself, as there is only 10 registered users for every registered domain. The paper shows how these numbers vary from the United states to the Middle East and Africa. In the US there is one domain name for every three users, however in the Middle East and Africa the number can go as high as 50 users per one domain. Geographies of representation also come into play within the (im)mutable augmentations of the world which is analysed by the geographies through digital representations. These representations can be named as the following; Google Search, OpenStreetMap, and the Semantic Web defined by Free-base and Geonames. These representations allow for the spatial differences in digital representation to be identified. Similarly to participation, representation also has an uneven representation of different platforms from different places around the world. Places such as North America and Europe remain over-represented and the rest of the world under-represented. Overall the paper discussed and analyses the key geographies of access, participation and representation through statistics and other bespoke data. This concludes that do to the digital divide and lack of access there remains uneven geographies, and the lack of access to participation and representation is also seen.
