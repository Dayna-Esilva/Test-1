         <p>Wake up , take a lil tablet for you know depression ðŸ˜‚ then I put pants on cause itâ€™s Poeâ€™s cold rn in winter. Then I feed my special old grumpy lady doggo, Spot , hen we go outside and stand in the sun for a while then we put some music on, hit a bong , go check on my plants - the weed first , then I go to Veronica (my Venus Fly Trap) to see how sheâ€™s doing - maybe give her some water in the pot you know. Then I have my moms little pink watering can and water all the bulbs. Then I go inside brush my teeth and begin my day ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>
