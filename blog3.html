            Semantic Markup, what is it and why is it necessary 
         </h1>
         <p>
           When discussing html it is important to understand what HTML stands for, Hyper-text Markup Language. Html creates a standard markup language for documents and this allows the documents to be displayed on a web browser. Now this is important to understand as when we focus on semantic markup, a whole new markup language is introduced. Semantic Markup allows for the online document to be edited and annotated in a way that is syntactically noticeable within the text. It is a certain method where content is represented. Semantic markup more specifically allows for the correct interpretation of the meaning of sentences or words. Semantic markup also allows for the markup and visual presentation of the elements within the document to remain separate. This allows the website to become more user friendly and allows bots to read through the coding much easier. However, even after understanding what Semantic markup means, we still have to answer why it is important. Semantic markup refers to certain HTML tags, but these tags are not chosen based on the way in which the show up within the web browser, instead they are selected in a specific way in order to show the structure and importance of the content. With HTML5 being introduced, the soul purpose was to make it easier for browsers and developers to differentiate between different types of data. Semantic tags such as section, article and nav help show the webpage the different level of importance for each item. Previously a webpage was only structured in divs, which gave no information about the hierarchy of the elements to the developers and bots. To break down the importance further, there are three main reasons why it is necessary for your site to be accessible by humans and computers: maintenance, SEO and accessibility. By using semantic markup you create a code that is very clear and standardised. This allows the code to be maintained for longer periods of time. It also allows for the content to be changed and updated very easily as it remains separate from the presentation. SEO also allows search engines to focus on what the valuable content it. By utilising semantic markup the valuable content is ensured to reach your target audience. When the h1 and h2 tags are used, they important key words are put forward to the search engines and thus to people who are searching for those keywords or anything related to your webpage. Lastly is accessibility, as when one is creating a website they must consider that they are creating for a world with all different kinds of people, including those with disabilities. Making websites or applications accessible for everyone allows people with disabilities to understand the HTML as well without having to customise their experience. It creates an easier experience for both people and machines.
