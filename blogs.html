<article><h2>The Library of Babel</h2>
    
    The library contains everything and is often described as infinite. The hexagonal shapes allows for the library to store as much information as possible and create a “necessary shape of absolute space”, (Borges, 1998) or at least the illusion of it. However if the exact number of books and words in each book is given is the number really an infinite one? Some idealists argue that “a triangular or pentagonal chamber is inconceivable” (Borges, 1998) which also questions whether the library is actually infinite or not. Men have also argued that that due to there being a mirror in the library, it can not be infinite as if it was “what need would there be for that illusory replication?”. (Borges, 1998) The librarian however is in belief of the library being infinite as he states that when he dies he will fall for ages and “my body will sink for ages”. (Borges, 1998) This creates an interesting argument and I think it is worth focusing on as the word infinite is often thrown around so carelessly. As humans do we have an access to an infinite amount of knowledge, and if not how do we know this? And if everything has already been written in these books then how can the amount of knowledge be infinite? These questions are vital as they show the importance of the library. Infinite or not, we know that the library "contains everything which can be expressed in all languages”, (Borges, 1998) meaning for every question or problem there is an answer or solution in some book, we must just know where to look. The library does however provide comfort in the fact that even if the human race becomes extinct, our knowledge or everything we could have learned will continue through these books from this library. The creation of this library was not only to create knowledge, but also to install hope, “The books reception creates order from disorder”. (Borges, 1998) This may seem unrealistic, like a joke or a hoax but surely enough as Basile insists: ‘Every possible permutation of letters is accessible at this very moment in one of the library’s books, only waiting its discovery’. But it is also a valid point to not get lost in the endless combinations in the books within the library. The people in Borge’s story who wander the library for years show a similar reflection in todays society and use of social media. It is easy to get lost on twitter or facebook or instagram trying to find some specific information however at the end of the day you are just wasting your time trying to find a combination of words that may never appear.

<article><h2>The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture</h2>
    Well before we look at the relationship that changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture have, we should make an effort to define each one on their own. Economists have defined technological change as “a shift to a new production function resulting from an increase in the efficiency of a product or process, is the main source of economic growth”. (Norcliffe 2020) This states that economists see technological change in a positive light. However this can not be the case as there is also a concern for the social implications. This is where I think, it links to the development and spread of internet culture. Internet culture is difficult to explain as the internet is so diverse that it makes it impossible to pinpoint certain things. However if you focus on technological advances and the affect that they have on social media, which does go under internet culture in my opinion, then you can begin to see the intriguing and love hate relationship that they have with one another. With the advancement of phones, computers, apps etc. many positives and negatives have arisen via social media. On the positive side it allows for more connections to be made and easier access to information. For adolescents who are finding themselves in this world it can create a sense of belonging or aid in the development of their identity, this too can contribute to ones mental health in a positive way. Platforms such as youtube create a new style of careers, where you can share your passion or any of your work with everyone online. The advancement of technology allows people from all over the world to work together and communicate from the comfort of their own homes. However, even with all the advancements and positive effects that they have had on social media, there is still a dark side. The internet creates a “paradox for social connectedness”. (A.Allen 2020) With the connectedness can also come an isolation. Due to technological advances, information is spread quickly and easily and once it is out there, there is no taking it back. On social media it creates “cancel culture” and allows hate to be spread within seconds. A simple tweet can lead to loss of your job and the end of your reputation. Cyberbullying has become a new norm for teenagers to grow up with and online predators can be found lurking everywhere. So is the link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture a good or a bad one? I think that depends on the generation you ask. Gen Z and millennials who have grown up around social media don’t know any different, and older generations don’t understand all the social media trends. I know I am speaking very broadly and assuming a lot, but maybe these are the conversations we should be having, because at the end of the day behind every phone, laptop, computer screen, is just another human being.

<article><h2>Semantic Markup, what is it and why is it necessary</h2>
When discussing html it is important to understand what HTML stands for, Hyper-text Markup Language. Html creates a standard markup language for documents and this allows the documents to be displayed on a web browser. Now this is important to understand as when we focus on semantic markup, a whole new markup language is introduced. Semantic Markup allows for the online document to be edited and annotated in a way that is syntactically noticeable within the text. It is a certain method where content is represented. Semantic markup more specifically allows for the correct interpretation of the meaning of sentences or words. Semantic markup also allows for the markup and visual presentation of the elements within the document to remain separate. This allows the website to become more user friendly and allows bots to read through the coding much easier. However, even after understanding what Semantic markup means, we still have to answer why it is important. Semantic markup refers to certain HTML tags, but these tags are not chosen based on the way in which the show up within the web browser, instead they are selected in a specific way in order to show the structure and importance of the content. With HTML5 being introduced, the soul purpose was to make it easier for browsers and developers to differentiate between different types of data. Semantic tags such as section, article and nav help show the webpage the different level of importance for each item. Previously a webpage was only structured in divs, which gave no information about the hierarchy of the elements to the developers and bots. To break down the importance further, there are three main reasons why it is necessary for your site to be accessible by humans and computers: maintenance, SEO and accessibility. By using semantic markup you create a code that is very clear and standardised. This allows the code to be maintained for longer periods of time. It also allows for the content to be changed and updated very easily as it remains separate from the presentation. SEO also allows search engines to focus on what the valuable content it. By utilising semantic markup the valuable content is ensured to reach your target audience. When the h1 and h2 tags are used, they important key words are put forward to the search engines and thus to people who are searching for those keywords or anything related to your webpage. Lastly is accessibility, as when one is creating a website they must consider that they are creating for a world with all different kinds of people, including those with disabilities. Making websites or applications accessible for everyone allows people with disabilities to understand the HTML as well without having to customise their experience. It creates an easier experience for both people and machines.

    <article><h2>How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h2>
        
The Canadian philosopher Marshal McLuhan created an interesting piece of work which included the study of media theory. Overtime it has become the most influential work that was written in the 60s and has shed immense light on how the world wide web effects humans and interactions today. The medium is the message shows how the medium becomes more valuable than the message itself as it has a direct and immediate effect on the message. Marshal McLuhan defines the medium as "any extension of ourselves.” When this is applied to humans and their understanding of the web things become interesting. Today digital media includes anything from the internet or mobile platforms as well as mass communication on these platforms. Therefore when discussing the medium of the web it will include: email, social media and websites.  As of 2021 over half of the worlds population is linked to social media or uses online tools in one way or another. Communicating via social media or anything online includes characteristics that change how a message is interpreted by one another, for example because of social media and the new language it creates when communicating with each other, people now physically say LOL when talking to each other instead of actually laughing. This shows how the web has not only become an extension of ourselves but is present in our everyday interactions. The web also becomes an extension of ourselves, however this can be seen as a good or a bad thing as the extension is not always an honest one. Users get to choose how they present themselves online, and this shows how the medium affects the individual, as they way it is used determines the value of it. Generation Z further shows how the web has changed how we interact with one another and see ourselves. In the past privacy was seen as binary, however due to how the web has evolved, younger generations now see privacy as scalable. (Heick, 2017) McLuhan argued that the medium is more powerful and impactful than we understand, “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”(McLuhan, 1964) This shows how detrimental the consequences of the web can be. From cyberbullying to canceling celebrity figures the medium can be used to harm others, sometimes even unintentionally. Once something is posted or uploaded there is no taking it back, and the medium will control how humans associate and interact with the post or upload. For example a simple tweet by Justine Sacco, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!”, managed to get her fired before she even landed in South Africa. This shows how powerful the medium is and how it becomes an extension of ourselves, even when we don’t want it to be. McLuhan also brings up another interesting point that can relate to how the ever fast changing and evolving technology affects individuals as well. McLuhan noticed that humans tend to focus a lot on the obvious, and by only focusing on the obvious we miss out on subtly structural changes that may occur over a long period of time. This can be linked to how our understanding of the web has dramatically changed since it first began, however we do not notice it as much as the technological advances are subtle. For example now days being tagged on social media or sent a DM is more than just a communication, younger generations often view it as a hug, a way of saying hello or even a passive-aggressive style of bullying. (Heick, 2017) This shows how much the medium has affected how we communicate and interact with each other day to day. The medium is the message creates a much grander understanding of the web, however the web is officially a part of our day to day lives, and with that in mind the relationship that we have with it should be reconsidered and re-evaluated.

<article><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2>
When a product or service is created online accessibility must be considered. Accessibility refers to how accessible a product is, and if it can be used by everyone, no matter how it is presented. Trying to accommodate everyone includes people with disabilities, and certain accessibility laws exist in order to ensure this. A designers aim is always to accommodate anyone in any way they can. Accessibility however must not be confused with usability. Both have similar properties in relation to the user experience design, however there are still major differences between them. Usability often refers to how effective and satisfying a product  is to use where as accessibility focuses more on if every user is able to have an equal user experience. Accessibility is important because it has become a standard of what is right to do, and it benefits all users. For example images can’t simply be coded as an image tag, but an alt tag must also be added in order for the bots to understand what the image is actually showing and to create an equal user experience. Subtitles also allow for videos to be understood even when on mute or when presented to someone with a hearing disability. In 2011 a World Health Organisation reported that if you do not make your website accessible to everyone you immediately exclude about 15% of the Earth’s population. Making a website accessible to everyone not only has benefits for users with disabilities but also has a number of other benefits: it improves SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) from semantic HTML, creates a better public image for ones brand, and allows more users on different devices and platforms to be presented with opportunities, and creates more settings/environments. Accessibility also includes making a site accessible for people with different resources or people of different ages. This social inclusion focuses on people in rural areas, older people and people who live in developing countries. Business wise there are also many benefits, as mentioned before it enhances ones brand, and also allows ones website to stay within certain jurisdictions, such as the E.U’s, which have created penalties for websites that fail to create accessible web designs. It is important to consider accessibility early on in the development process, as it is easier to fix or address them in the earlier stages than the later stages. Simple steps can be taken to do this, such as changing certain settings in a browser, and by doing this more aspects of accessibility can be evaluated. When a website is fully coded and uploaded another check through must occur in order to ensure that all guidelines are met. There are certain evaluation tools that can be used to ensure that this process runs efficiently. However even with the help of these tools, human knowledge is still needed to make sure that the site is 100% accessible to all users. All in all accessibility benefits businesses, individuals and society, and by sticking to certain international web standards the level of what is required can easily be reached.
