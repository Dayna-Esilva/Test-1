<article><h2>The Library of Babel</h2>
    <img src="./img/librarybabel.jpg" alt="library image" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
    
    <p>The library contains everything and is often described as infinite. The hexagonal shapes allows for the library to store as much information as possible and create a “necessary shape of absolute space”, (Borges, 1998) or at least the illusion of it. However if the exact number of books and words in each book is given is the number really an infinite one? Some idealists argue that “a triangular or pentagonal chamber is inconceivable” (Borges, 1998) which also questions whether the library is actually infinite or not. Men have also argued that that due to there being a mirror in the library, it can not be infinite as if it was “what need would there be for that illusory replication?”. (Borges, 1998) The librarian however is in belief of the library being infinite as he states that when he dies he will fall for ages and “my body will sink for ages”. (Borges, 1998) This creates an interesting argument and I think it is worth focusing on as the word infinite is often thrown around so carelessly. As humans do we have an access to an infinite amount of knowledge, and if not how do we know this? And if everything has already been written in these books then how can the amount of knowledge be infinite? These questions are vital as they show the importance of the library. Infinite or not, we know that the library "contains everything which can be expressed in all languages”, (Borges, 1998) meaning for every question or problem there is an answer or solution in some book, we must just know where to look. The library does however provide comfort in the fact that even if the human race becomes extinct, our knowledge or everything we could have learned will continue through these books from this library. The creation of this library was not only to create knowledge, but also to install hope, “The books reception creates order from disorder”. (Borges, 1998) This may seem unrealistic, like a joke or a hoax but surely enough as Basile insists: ‘Every possible permutation of letters is accessible at this very moment in one of the library’s books, only waiting its discovery’. But it is also a valid point to not get lost in the endless combinations in the books within the library. The people in Borge’s story who wander the library for years show a similar reflection in todays society and use of social media. It is easy to get lost on twitter or facebook or instagram trying to find some specific information however at the end of the day you are just wasting your time trying to find a combination of words that may never appear.

<article><h2>The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture</h2>
   
    <img src="./img/Technology-World.jpg" alt="technology" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 

    <p>Well before we look at the relationship that changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture have, we should make an effort to define each one on their own. Economists have defined technological change as “a shift to a new production function resulting from an increase in the efficiency of a product or process, is the main source of economic growth”. (Norcliffe 2020) This states that economists see technological change in a positive light. However this can not be the case as there is also a concern for the social implications. This is where I think, it links to the development and spread of internet culture. Internet culture is difficult to explain as the internet is so diverse that it makes it impossible to pinpoint certain things. However if you focus on technological advances and the affect that they have on social media, which does go under internet culture in my opinion, then you can begin to see the intriguing and love hate relationship that they have with one another. With the advancement of phones, computers, apps etc. many positives and negatives have arisen via social media. On the positive side it allows for more connections to be made and easier access to information. For adolescents who are finding themselves in this world it can create a sense of belonging or aid in the development of their identity, this too can contribute to ones mental health in a positive way. Platforms such as youtube create a new style of careers, where you can share your passion or any of your work with everyone online. The advancement of technology allows people from all over the world to work together and communicate from the comfort of their own homes. However, even with all the advancements and positive effects that they have had on social media, there is still a dark side. The internet creates a “paradox for social connectedness”. (A.Allen 2020) With the connectedness can also come an isolation. Due to technological advances, information is spread quickly and easily and once it is out there, there is no taking it back. On social media it creates “cancel culture” and allows hate to be spread within seconds. A simple tweet can lead to loss of your job and the end of your reputation. Cyberbullying has become a new norm for teenagers to grow up with and online predators can be found lurking everywhere. So is the link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture a good or a bad one? I think that depends on the generation you ask. Gen Z and millennials who have grown up around social media don’t know any different, and older generations don’t understand all the social media trends. I know I am speaking very broadly and assuming a lot, but maybe these are the conversations we should be having, because at the end of the day behind every phone, laptop, computer screen, is just another human being.

<article><h2>Semantic Markup, what is it and why is it necessary</h2>
    <img src="./img/semantic000.png" alt="semantic markup" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
<p>When discussing html it is important to understand what HTML stands for, Hyper-text Markup Language. Html creates a standard markup language for documents and this allows the documents to be displayed on a web browser. Now this is important to understand as when we focus on semantic markup, a whole new markup language is introduced. Semantic Markup allows for the online document to be edited and annotated in a way that is syntactically noticeable within the text. It is a certain method where content is represented. Semantic markup more specifically allows for the correct interpretation of the meaning of sentences or words. Semantic markup also allows for the markup and visual presentation of the elements within the document to remain separate. This allows the website to become more user friendly and allows bots to read through the coding much easier. However, even after understanding what Semantic markup means, we still have to answer why it is important. Semantic markup refers to certain HTML tags, but these tags are not chosen based on the way in which the show up within the web browser, instead they are selected in a specific way in order to show the structure and importance of the content. With HTML5 being introduced, the soul purpose was to make it easier for browsers and developers to differentiate between different types of data. Semantic tags such as section, article and nav help show the webpage the different level of importance for each item. Previously a webpage was only structured in divs, which gave no information about the hierarchy of the elements to the developers and bots. To break down the importance further, there are three main reasons why it is necessary for your site to be accessible by humans and computers: maintenance, SEO and accessibility. By using semantic markup you create a code that is very clear and standardised. This allows the code to be maintained for longer periods of time. It also allows for the content to be changed and updated very easily as it remains separate from the presentation. SEO also allows search engines to focus on what the valuable content it. By utilising semantic markup the valuable content is ensured to reach your target audience. When the h1 and h2 tags are used, they important key words are put forward to the search engines and thus to people who are searching for those keywords or anything related to your webpage. Lastly is accessibility, as when one is creating a website they must consider that they are creating for a world with all different kinds of people, including those with disabilities. Making websites or applications accessible for everyone allows people with disabilities to understand the HTML as well without having to customise their experience. It creates an easier experience for both people and machines.

    <article><h2>How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h2>
        <img src="./img/medium.jpeg" alt="quote" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
<p>The Canadian philosopher Marshal McLuhan created an interesting piece of work which included the study of media theory. Overtime it has become the most influential work that was written in the 60s and has shed immense light on how the world wide web effects humans and interactions today. The medium is the message shows how the medium becomes more valuable than the message itself as it has a direct and immediate effect on the message. Marshal McLuhan defines the medium as "any extension of ourselves.” When this is applied to humans and their understanding of the web things become interesting. Today digital media includes anything from the internet or mobile platforms as well as mass communication on these platforms. Therefore when discussing the medium of the web it will include: email, social media and websites.  As of 2021 over half of the worlds population is linked to social media or uses online tools in one way or another. Communicating via social media or anything online includes characteristics that change how a message is interpreted by one another, for example because of social media and the new language it creates when communicating with each other, people now physically say LOL when talking to each other instead of actually laughing. This shows how the web has not only become an extension of ourselves but is present in our everyday interactions. The web also becomes an extension of ourselves, however this can be seen as a good or a bad thing as the extension is not always an honest one. Users get to choose how they present themselves online, and this shows how the medium affects the individual, as they way it is used determines the value of it. Generation Z further shows how the web has changed how we interact with one another and see ourselves. In the past privacy was seen as binary, however due to how the web has evolved, younger generations now see privacy as scalable. (Heick, 2017) McLuhan argued that the medium is more powerful and impactful than we understand, “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”(McLuhan, 1964) This shows how detrimental the consequences of the web can be. From cyberbullying to canceling celebrity figures the medium can be used to harm others, sometimes even unintentionally. Once something is posted or uploaded there is no taking it back, and the medium will control how humans associate and interact with the post or upload. For example a simple tweet by Justine Sacco, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!”, managed to get her fired before she even landed in South Africa. This shows how powerful the medium is and how it becomes an extension of ourselves, even when we don’t want it to be. McLuhan also brings up another interesting point that can relate to how the ever fast changing and evolving technology affects individuals as well. McLuhan noticed that humans tend to focus a lot on the obvious, and by only focusing on the obvious we miss out on subtly structural changes that may occur over a long period of time. This can be linked to how our understanding of the web has dramatically changed since it first began, however we do not notice it as much as the technological advances are subtle. For example now days being tagged on social media or sent a DM is more than just a communication, younger generations often view it as a hug, a way of saying hello or even a passive-aggressive style of bullying. (Heick, 2017) This shows how much the medium has affected how we communicate and interact with each other day to day. The medium is the message creates a much grander understanding of the web, however the web is officially a part of our day to day lives, and with that in mind the relationship that we have with it should be reconsidered and re-evaluated.

<article><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2>
    <img src="./img/accessibility.jpg" alt="accessibility" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
<p>When a product or service is created online accessibility must be considered. Accessibility refers to how accessible a product is, and if it can be used by everyone, no matter how it is presented. Trying to accommodate everyone includes people with disabilities, and certain accessibility laws exist in order to ensure this. A designers aim is always to accommodate anyone in any way they can. Accessibility however must not be confused with usability. Both have similar properties in relation to the user experience design, however there are still major differences between them. Usability often refers to how effective and satisfying a product  is to use where as accessibility focuses more on if every user is able to have an equal user experience. Accessibility is important because it has become a standard of what is right to do, and it benefits all users. For example images can’t simply be coded as an image tag, but an alt tag must also be added in order for the bots to understand what the image is actually showing and to create an equal user experience. Subtitles also allow for videos to be understood even when on mute or when presented to someone with a hearing disability. In 2011 a World Health Organisation reported that if you do not make your website accessible to everyone you immediately exclude about 15% of the Earth’s population. Making a website accessible to everyone not only has benefits for users with disabilities but also has a number of other benefits: it improves SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) from semantic HTML, creates a better public image for ones brand, and allows more users on different devices and platforms to be presented with opportunities, and creates more settings/environments. Accessibility also includes making a site accessible for people with different resources or people of different ages. This social inclusion focuses on people in rural areas, older people and people who live in developing countries. Business wise there are also many benefits, as mentioned before it enhances ones brand, and also allows ones website to stay within certain jurisdictions, such as the E.U’s, which have created penalties for websites that fail to create accessible web designs. It is important to consider accessibility early on in the development process, as it is easier to fix or address them in the earlier stages than the later stages. Simple steps can be taken to do this, such as changing certain settings in a browser, and by doing this more aspects of accessibility can be evaluated. When a website is fully coded and uploaded another check through must occur in order to ensure that all guidelines are met. There are certain evaluation tools that can be used to ensure that this process runs efficiently. However even with the help of these tools, human knowledge is still needed to make sure that the site is 100% accessible to all users. All in all accessibility benefits businesses, individuals and society, and by sticking to certain international web standards the level of what is required can easily be reached.

    <h2>What is/are the digital divide/s and how do they affect us/you?</h2>
    <img src="./img/digitaldivide.jpg" alt="plug unplugged" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
    <p>The Digital Divide focuses on those members of society who don’t have access to computers or the internet. This refers to underprivileged members of society such as the poor, handicapped, rural and elderly portion. The focus is on the gap between these members and the wealthy middle class urban members of society. Race, class and gender all come into play when discussing the digital divide, especially the intersectionality of all these groups. When accessing what creates the gap between these members of society, three levels come into play; access, how the internet is used/the inequalities that exist, and the social/cultural benefits. The digital divide also includes the social capital, which refers to the different relationships between individuals, otherwise known as human interrelationship.  It is vital to focus on the digital divide as it is only birthing the divisions in society, such as the distribution of wealth. Those who have access to computers and the internet have access to expanding knowledge and communication platforms, while those who do not can not become richer through the power of information. The aim is to close the digital divide, as we live in a society that is so linked to technology, and if you do not have access to it, you will be left in the dark ages and the divide will continue to widen. The digital divide can already be seen in society today, and it has many compounding effects. When analysing the digital divide, wealth and access to computers are not the only things that should be considered, as illiteracy plays a huge role as well. The digital divide can not be closed if literacy is not promoted all over the world in the first place. 
In South Africa members of society who are excluded from technology are severely affected and this creates a huge inequality, including career and education opportunities. However in South Africa the issue is not only access, but also empowering people to become confident enough to use computers and understand technology. Again this references the literacy and educational standards within the South African population. When trying to find a long term solution to solving the digital divide within South Africa the focus should be on trying to uplift the socio-economic standard of the community. South Africa also faces a huge struggle in bridging this gap as we are such an inequitable society with a huge difference between the wealthy and poor people. “The 2001 Jensen research found that Internet access in South Africa was largely confined to urban areas, and that Internet users were predominantly white, city-dwellers, relatively affluent and well educated.”, this further shows how big the divide within our society is. The main focus stands with education, as previously disadvantaged communities have not been exposed to technology and computer literacy. “Through appropriate technologies, it is hoped that South Africa will leapfrog into the new century, bypassing the unnecessary adoption cycle, and implement a solution that works now, and has the capacity to handle future developments” (Department of Education 2003:10).”

    <h2>Methods for analysis and critiques of UX and/or UI (based on additional research and readings)
    </h2>
    <img src="./img/UIUX.png" alt="UIUX" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
  <p> User experience references and measures the interaction between a users and a user interface, for example a website or an app. Measurement tools such as heat mapping, A/B testing and marketing research are often used to analyse user experience. By using these tools certain conclusions can be made and the website or web design is then changed or adapted in order to create a more suitable user experience. This improvement of a website or web design allows for the increase if user engagement and this engagement is referred to as user interface design (UI). The overall aim is to increase the amount of time that a user spends on a page or website, which leads to online lead generation and lead conversion. Thanks to the different methods of analysis for websites, how the user interacts with a website can be measured. It is important to be able to identify the elements that make users spend longer on the page and which elements cause users to leave a page. These two things are known as “page stay” and “bouncing and exiting”. A/B testing on the other hand allows differentiations of things, such as a button colour or text, to be tested and examined in a controlled environment. Heat mapping uses the motion of the mouse to track where a users eye is on the screen, as there is a known connection between the mouse movement and eye focus. Not only are all these tools and many more very informative, but they are also highly actionable. When critiquing the UX or creating a design critique one often gives feedback, after the design has been analysed, and states whether it is meeting its objectives or not. However the design is not judged or harshly evaluated, but rather a group of people gather together to create a conversation with a main goal of aiming to improve the overall design. Often design critiques split into two different categories; design reviews and standalone critiques. Evaluations of a design are made based off a set of heuristics when looking at design reviews, and these are often done by a usability expert or in a meeting at the end of the creative process. Standalone critiques however are meeting where the purpose is only to focus and improve on one piece of particular work. A UI critique however does not solely focus on the presentation of the product in the moment, but rather on how it works over a period of time and whether it is best suiting the user’s needs. When critiquing both UX and UI, it is important to stay objective within the discussion and consider the mental modal of each individual who is interacting with the design, and this becomes a critical part in how the solution is formed.

    <h2>Ethical implementation of UX
    </h2>
    <img src="./img/ethics.webp" alt="ethics" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
    <p>Ethical implementation of the UX occurs when one crosses the line of making easy and quick decisions to better the system instead of those that better the users experience. When dealing with the user experience its must be a fully thought out process where all aspects are considered. Topics and issues that arise must also be addressed in a professional manner. UX always has a main aim of creating a website or platform that makes users feel comfortable and easy to interact with. Seeing as users of today can leave reviews or comments of a site or app online very easily, it is important to aim for positive critiques as this will lead to good PR. This is why planning is so important and why all ethical concerns must be addressed in order to avoid any public disasters. However ethics in UX is not seen as a binding rule, but rather a number of professional tips that ultimately help you improve your predicted for your targeted users. Things such as micro-actions and processes with in reference to requests for permissions, registration and monetisation are often the topics that a creator should surround with ethical questions. For each of theses questions, the best solution should always be found, and not the easiest or quickest. An example of ethical implementation can be seen in social apps such as Skype, as it offers the opportunity to be connected without being seen. This is seen in many other platforms and it focuses on the users value of privacy. Therefore the social/commercial need becomes over ridden by the customers need for privacy, and this becomes an ethical consideration that must be addressed in all social platforms. This creation of privacy and accompanying the users needs creates an environment where people become more willing to try new apps or websites. It will always be beneficial to allow for there to be flexibility towards the users needs. Allow people to share want only they want to share creates a more trusting user base and therefore ultimately allows new users to operate in an unregistered mode. Ethical considerations must also be implemented when passwords or banking details are required. It is the platforms responsibility to make the user feel that they can trust the platform with this information and in turn, the platform must have safety measures in place that create this trust.

    <h2>What is information geography and why does it matter?
    </h2>
    <img src="./img/geography.jpg" alt="a world" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
    <p>
        GIS otherwise known as geography information system is a business information management system that allows data to be captured and then analysed on a spatial information map. Through the use of this geography better decisions can be made. GIS can find patterns in activities which allows for more trends and patterns to be displayed on  digital map. The map being digital makes the data more easily visible and understandable in comparison to displaying it on a spreadsheet. GIS software can be found running on computers which may have very powerful servers or it can even be found on your phone. A GIS stores information about the real world and this stored through a group of thematic layers which are linked by geography. The internet is clarified by distinct geographies. All the information on the technology has to exist somewhere. There are two important points to recognise when talking about internet geographies; data shadows which are   
“the layers of digital information about places (Graham 2010)” and the digital divisions of labor which is the “distinct and uneven geographies of the production of digital information (Graham 2014).  The geographies  of information contribute to how we produce, enact, and reproduce political processes and practices as well as social and economic practices. Maps help to make sense of things and using maps geographic information can be better understood and this can contribute to a better understanding of how the connectivity of the web is around the world. The reason why GIS is so important is because it has so many different applications. This technology can be applied in many different ways, for example to aid and develop humanitarian aids and planning businesses and market research and itnellegiance and so on. Another very relevant examples is apps such as uber eats and google maps and the geographical amps allow for ones device to be tracked and the location to be determined. GIS is important as show in the above example it helps individuals and organisations become more aware and unstained spatial patterns and relationships. With GIS being able to access any information which includes location, a lot of advancements can be made. With this system the location can be displayed in different formats, such as address, latitude and longitude or ZIP code. GIS allows for the comparison of different things and it also compares hw they relate to one another. For example if a factory were to be built it was need to reference a geographical map to ensure it does not pollute any near by water sources. This is what makes GIS so important and why we will continue to use it amongst many technological platforms.

<h2>
    A critical analysis of your own UX and UI 
 
</h2>
<img src="./img/ownux.jpg" alt="Homepage design" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 

<p>
    When designing a platform is is important to remember that designing and problem solving go hand in hand. There must first be a full understanding of what the problem is in order to solve it and maintain a clear vision of what the next step in the process it. When evaluating UX and UI certain things need to have answers and aspects must be considered; you must be aware of the problem that you are trying to solve, the users needs must be considered, such their goals and limitations, and the constraints of the project must be included. A criticism of UI and UX often comes from the check ups and fixing of all mistakes that comes in the earliest stages of the platforms developed and the final checks to ensure that everything is working how it is supposed to. It is also important to stay inline with what the users and business goals are, as they are previously determined and need to be implemented correctly. It is extremely important to identify what is needed and what are mistakes. The platform also needs to be critiqued on efficiency, and the visual hierarchy of the elements must reflect that efficient ness. The contrast of elements must also be displayed correctly, and a critique behind this is that it needs a larger group to agree on the look as well as a professional. The Law of Proximity must also be implemented correctly do that the elements are positioned in the most optimal way. When analysing the UI they must that the platform is well-designed, easy to understand and use, as expert users have certain standers and the platform must be able to support the users decision making especially when under pressure. If these standards are not met in can result in huge consequences, such as large financial losses and environmental damage. When creating my website I aimed to create an easy and simple design that was easy to understand and easily accessible. The design aims to create light hearted goofiness that resonates with the character who is artsy and expressive. The interface should feel open and flowing and centre the users few to certain pinpoints allowing the user to stay focused and become engaged. The decor or images on the site shall remain a part of it but not become too distracting as to draw away from the text. I have taken careful considerations of the colours that are used to to not make them too contrasting or harsh on the eye. The page should resonate with nature and abstract art as to make the user feel more engaged with the character of the page. easy drop down menus and nav bars are used to help the user easily navigate between platforms, thus allowing the user to stay further engaged. Any mistakes or flaws will be heavily evaluated and then appropriate changes will be made to ensure the improvement of the user experience and interface.

        <h2>Geographies of information - a critical discussion
        </h2>
        <img src="./img/geog.jpg" alt="3d map" width="250" height="220" class="center"> 
        <p>
            Geographies of information are extremely important and valuable as they contribute to how we are able to understand and interpret different parts of the world. However one must not over simplify geographic augmentations, they not only represent places, they become a very part of that place, and hence the word ‘shape’ is used when referring to a geographical location. When discussing geographies you must keep three factors in mind; geographies of participation, of access and of representation. Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies” discussed a wide variety of platforms such as hosting, delivering and mediating many different types of geographic information. The main feature of the paper however focuses on how geographic information in its own way is distinguished by a host of uneven geographies. Immutable mobiles also plays a huge role in information geographies as it refers to “are those objects produced by inscription and transported back to the centre, and then combined with other such objects.” (Latour, 1986) A perfect example would be a digital map. This creation of immutable mobiles became a huge part of history and society as this meant that power and the control of information is linked. Therefore, when referencing geography of information one can conclude that the geographic spread of information is and always will be linked to control and power formation. Another point to focus on about the immutable augmentations and mobile tools is how they allow us to access certain information and how not everyone has immediate access to this information as the whole world does not have access to the internet. The digital divide shows this gap clearly. However it is not a complete set back as in comparison to pre-digital geographies of information, the opportunity to equalise the amount of people who have access to and can contribute knowledge online has improved immensely, and this improvement does not rely on their geographic placing.

Geographies also rely on the understanding of geographies of participation. When discussing geographies of participation there are three variables that must be kept in mind: domain names, Github users and Wikipedia edits. These domains do not simply stand on their own, but they also stand for many global communities and go beyond the details of any singular place. By investigating the relationship between these three domains, patterns in participation can be observed as well as understand how differently each user interacts with each platform. However when examining how these domains are used globally, a bipartite relationship reveals itself, as there is only 10 registered users for every registered domain. The paper shows how these numbers vary from the United states to the Middle East and Africa. In the US there is one domain name for every three users, however in the Middle East and Africa the number can go as high as 50 users per one domain. Geographies of representation also come into play within the (im)mutable augmentations of the world which is analysed by the geographies through digital representations. These representations can be named as the following; Google Search, OpenStreetMap, and the Semantic Web defined by Free-base and Geonames. These representations allow for the spatial differences in digital representation to be identified. Similarly to participation, representation also has an uneven representation of different platforms from different places around the world. Places such as North America and Europe remain over-represented and the rest of the world under-represented. 
Overall the paper discussed and analyses the key geographies of access, participation and representation through statistics and other bespoke data. This concludes that do to the digital divide and lack of access there remains uneven geographies, and the lack of access to participation and representation is also seen.
