         <h1>The importance of Accessibility
        </h1>
        <p>When a product or service is created online accessibility must be considered. Accessibility refers to how accessible a product is, and if it can be used by everyone, no matter how it is presented. Trying to accommodate everyone includes people with disabilities, and certain accessibility laws exist in order to ensure this. A designers aim is always to accommodate anyone in any way they can. Accessibility however must not be confused with usability. Both have similar properties in relation to the user experience design, however there are still major differences between them. Usability often refers to how effective and satisfying a product is to use where as accessibility focuses more on if every user is able to have an equal user experience. Accessibility is important because it has become a standard of what is right to do, and it benefits all users. For example images can’t simply be coded as an image tag, but an alt tag must also be added in order for the bots to understand what the image is actually showing and to create an equal user experience. Subtitles also allow for videos to be understood even when on mute or when presented to someone with a hearing disability. In 2011 a World Health Organisation reported that if you do not make your website accessible to everyone you immediately exclude about 15% of the Earth’s population. Making a website accessible to everyone not only has benefits for users with disabilities but also has a number of other benefits: it improves SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) from semantic HTML, creates a better public image for ones brand, and allows more users on different devices and platforms to be presented with opportunities, and creates more settings/environments. Accessibility also includes making a site accessible for people with different resources or people of different ages. This social inclusion focuses on people in rural areas, older people and people who live in developing countries. Business wise there are also many benefits, as mentioned before it enhances ones brand, and also allows ones website to stay within certain jurisdictions, such as the E.U’s, which have created penalties for websites that fail to create accessible web designs. It is important to consider accessibility early on in the development process, as it is easier to fix or address them in the earlier stages than the later stages. Simple steps can be taken to do this, such as changing certain settings in a browser, and by doing this more aspects of accessibility can be evaluated. When a website is fully coded and uploaded another check through must occur in order to ensure that all guidelines are met. There are certain evaluation tools that can be used to ensure that this process runs efficiently. However even with the help of these tools, human knowledge is still needed to make sure that the site is 100% accessible to all users. All in all accessibility benefits businesses, individuals and society, and by sticking to certain international web standards the level of what is required can easily be reached.
