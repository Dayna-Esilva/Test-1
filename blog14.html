         <h1>Claire Bell</h1>
         <p>This character is a very curious and eccentric and odd person. She lives in Joburg and studies at Open Window. She is studying design and illustration and has decided to practice what she has learnt through designing and building her own website. She aims to learn more about the online world while also leaving an impression of herself and what she enjoys online. The style and design are extremely important and she is constantly coming up with new design ideas for her varsity work as well as the website. When it comes to content she plans to share her own life experiences, pleasures and how to deal with mental disorders. She is a very honest and open student who aims to provide ways for students to destress and relax. She is a vegetarian but still a major foodie, and loves spending time and taking her old dog, Spot, for walks. She is a lover of all animals and sometimes even prefers them to humans. She has an extremely artistic eye and is also good at photographing the intriguing parts of Joburg.
