         <h1>A critical analysis of your own UX and UI </h1>
         <p>When designing a platform is is important to remember that designing and problem solving go hand in hand. There must first be a full understanding of what the problem is in order to solve it and maintain a clear vision of what the next step in the process it. When evaluating UX and UI certain things need to have answers and aspects must be considered; you must be aware of the problem that you are trying to solve, the users needs must be considered, such their goals and limitations, and the constraints of the project must be included. A criticism of UI and UX often comes from the check ups and fixing of all mistakes that comes in the earliest stages of the platforms developed and the final checks to ensure that everything is working how it is supposed to. It is also important to stay inline with what the users and business goals are, as they are previously determined and need to be implemented correctly. It is extremely important to identify what is needed and what are mistakes. The platform also needs to be critiqued on efficiency, and the visual hierarchy of the elements must reflect that efficient ness. The contrast of elements must also be displayed correctly, and a critique behind this is that it needs a larger group to agree on the look as well as a professional. The Law of Proximity must also be implemented correctly do that the elements are positioned in the most optimal way. When analysing the UI they must that the platform is well-designed, easy to understand and use, as expert users have certain standers and the platform must be able to support the users decision making especially when under pressure. If these standards are not met in can result in huge consequences, such as large financial losses and environmental damage. When creating my website I aimed to create an easy and simple design that was easy to understand and easily accessible. The design aims to create light hearted goofiness that resonates with the character who is artsy and expressive. The interface should feel open and flowing and centre the users few to certain pinpoints allowing the user to stay focused and become engaged. The decor or images on the site shall remain a part of it but not become too distracting as to draw away from the text. I have taken careful considerations of the colours that are used to to not make them too contrasting or harsh on the eye. The page should resonate with nature and abstract art as to make the user feel more engaged with the character of the page. easy drop down menus and nav bars are used to help the user easily navigate between platforms, thus allowing the user to stay further engaged. Any mistakes or flaws will be heavily evaluated and then appropriate changes will be made to ensure the improvement of the user experience and interface.
