         <h1>Reflection on your experience taking the Implicit Bias Tests and how Implicit Bias impacts software development.</h1>
         <p>The Evaluative Priming Task (EPT) was a very interesting and eye opening assessment, however I do not thing the results are 100% accurate. The two people we were meant to judge, were shown to us and their characteristics were explained. Immediately I had a certain preference to the artsy and non-stereotypical male, James, how ever I had no prejudices against Chris. After the speedy test of positive and negative words and their association to them, my results stated that I had no preference towards either Chris or James. This is not completely true, but does point to some accuracy, as under pressure I assumed the best of each of these men, however when not placed under a time limit and allowed to fully absorb the information my preference was James. Before moving forward it is important to understand how the EPT works. The test makes use of priming, which is a psychological phenomenon. This refers to the automatic reposes one has to mental concepts of ones judgements. Research does show that when one is pressured to place a good or a bad word to a face briefly presented to you, you are more likely to choose the positive word, if the word prior was a positive word, this works the same the other way round. Overall, this categorisation shows what peoples automatic responses are to the prime categories, in comparison to each other. Many products and online services have been built with inherent bias, and with the ever-growing web this is becoming more and more prominent. With the dude growing gap within STEM, technology is being built in a very specific way that does not always account for all users. The amount of women programmers for example, which is 8%, shows that women need to have more of an equal opportunity to contribute and shape what the world looks like. Technology can not be constrained to one gender, it is merely a tool, but by including everyone equally, less bias can be implemented. An example of a biased piece of technology can be seen within the Apple Watch which launched in 2015. Studies found that the watch was less likely to interact with people who had tattoos on their arms or darker skin. The issue focused on the green light censor, which was more likely to be reactive to people with skin with higher melanin. This shows how when testing a product, a diverse group of people must be used, in order to avoid prejudice or bias. The importance of including diversity when developing a product is vital, and does produce positive results. research has shown that when a more diverse team is used in development, that product will receive better financial returns. Effective teams include diversity as much as possible. However this still comes with its own challenges. With greater diversity come more options that need to be considered. This is not a bad thing but rather challenged the group to come together and form an agreement. This also leads to a more rich and evolving conversation which creates a stimulating environment. This allows teams to widen their perceptions, and therefore eliminate previous biases.
